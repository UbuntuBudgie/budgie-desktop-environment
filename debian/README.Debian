Crystal Dock for Ubuntu
=================================

Default configuration handling
------------------------------

Crystal Dock uses XDG_CONFIG_DIRS to locate its default
configuration and copies those defaults into the user's
home directory (~/.config/crystal-dock) on first run only.

Once a user configuration exists, it is never modified
automatically by package upgrades.

Versioned system defaults
-------------------------

The Crystal Dock default configuration is versioned and
installed under:

  /etc/xdg/crystal-dock-<N>

where <N> is a configuration version.

The unversioned path:

  /etc/xdg/crystal-dock

is a symbolic link pointing to the current default
configuration directory.

Each incompatible change to the default configuration
results in a new versioned directory being installed.
Older versions are retained to avoid modifying existing
systems.

Deprecated configuration directories
------------------------------------

Older /etc/xdg/crystal-dock-<N> directories are considered
deprecated once a newer version is installed.

They are intentionally not removed or modified
automatically, in accordance with Debian policy regarding
configuration files.

Administrators may safely remove deprecated directories
manually if they are no longer needed.

User configuration migration
----------------------------

No automatic migration of user configuration is performed.

If users wish to adopt new defaults, they must remove their
existing ~/.config/crystal-dock directory and start Crystal
Dock again, or manually copy configuration files as desired.
