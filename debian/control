Description: GUI and keyboard friendly window arranger
 Window Shuffler is a window placement application. Click a window and
 subsequently click a tile in the grid, the window moves to the
 corresponding position on the screen. Shift-click two tiles will make the
 window span the two. Shift-click does not need to be on two tiles next to
 each other; cross-selection and spanning multiple tiles is possible.
 .
 Options include: quick-grid all windows into the current grid, take a
 snapshot of current layout, reset to snapshot. The application comes with a
 list of shortcuts, which can be called by pressing [ i ].
 Window Shuffler supports multi-monitor setup. Windows are positioned in the
 grid per screen.
